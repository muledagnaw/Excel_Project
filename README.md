### Key findings from the PivotTable include:
* **Cornwall** and **Essex** as top-performing counties
* **Laptops** as the highest-selling product overall
* Total sales volume of **5,200 units** across all counties
* **High Sales**: Cornwall (Laptops), Essex (Printers)
* **Medium Sales**: Most Laptop and Smartphone sales
* **Low Sales**: Smartphones in Yorkshire and Lancashire, Laptops in Durham

This categorisation helps quickly identify **strong and weak-performing products**.
