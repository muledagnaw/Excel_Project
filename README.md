## 🔁 Sales Categorisation Using the SWITCH Function

To simplify performance analysis, the **SWITCH function** was used to categorise products based on their sales volume.

### 📌 Sales Volume Categories

* **High** – Sales greater than 600
* **Medium** – Sales between 300 and 600
* **Low** – Sales less than 300

This approach makes it easy to quickly identify strong and weak-performing products at a glance.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Pivot Table

* **Cornwall** and **Essex** emerged as the top-performing counties
* **Laptops** were the highest-selling product overall
* Total combined sales reached **5,200 units**
* **High Sales**

  * Cornwall: Laptops
  * Essex: Printers
* **Medium Sales**

  * Most Laptop and Smartphone sales across counties
* **Low Sales**

  * Smartphones in Yorkshire and Lancashire
  * Laptops in Durham

These insights help stakeholders focus on areas of strong performance while identifying opportunities for improvement.
