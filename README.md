The Dataset that we used <img width="1108" height="500" alt="dataset" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b3c9e9-871e-49d9-a2a9-dd27be131f8a" />

### 🔹 Pivot Table Analysis

A Pivot Table was created to summarise **Sales Volume by County and Product**, revealing:


* **Cornwall** and **Essex** as top-performing counties
* **Laptops** as the highest-selling product overall
* Total sales volume of **5,200 units** across all counties

### 🔹 Sales Volume Categorisation

The **SWITCH function** was used to classify sales performance:

```excel
=SWITCH(TRUE, C2 > 600, "High", C2 >= 300, "Medium", "Low")
```

#### Results:
